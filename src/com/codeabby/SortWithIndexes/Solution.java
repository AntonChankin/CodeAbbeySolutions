/**
 * After solving the task Bubble Sort you are supposed to learn about sorting arrays. Now we have a bit more complicated programming problem for you, since it is important to have practice in sorting and handling not only primitive values but also more complex objects.
 *
 *  As previously, you are given an array of numbers. It should be sorted and then for each value (in non-decreasing order) its initial index should be printed (indexes should start from 1).
 *
 *  I.e., suppose we have an array 50 98 17 79 which after sorting becomes 17 50 79 98. Now:
 *
 *  17 was at 3-rd place initially
 *  50 was at 1-st place initially
 *  79 was at 4-th place initially
 *  98 was at 2-nd place initially
 *
 *  so result is
 *   3 1 4 2
 * Initial data will contain array size at first line and array values itself in the second (integers separated by spaces).
 * Answer should contain initial indexes of the array members disturbed by sorting.
